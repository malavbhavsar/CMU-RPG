CMU-RPG
========
An RPG game for all Tartans!

CMU-RPG simulates CMU life. Rest of the description is game logic: Each player will get same amount of energy, money, intelligence, memory and experience in the start. There will be four courses and some activities(preparing for interviews, networking) which a player can do. To do these activities player needs energy, which can be replenished by sleeping. The goal is to get perfect GPA and get a job. Important part is: player can control his character only by ruby code. Server will run the code every 1 hour and do the activity for that hour.
